# **AdminRTR**

## **Project Description**
AdminRTR is an implementation of AdminLTE using ReactJS and React Router. Its primary goal is to provide a dynamic and easy-to-use administration panel by leveraging ReactJS components integrated with AdminLTE.

## **Technologies Used**
- **ReactJS**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing for better code maintainability and safety.
- **Jest**: Framework for unit testing.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for styling.
- **AdminLTE**: A Bootstrap-based theme for admin panels.
- **NPM**: Package manager.
- **NVM**: Node Version Manager for managing Node.js versions.

## **Prerequisites**
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- **NVM** (Node Version Manager)
- **NPM** version `20.18.0`

Verify that Node.js and NPM are correctly configured using NVM.

## **Installation**
You can install AdminRTR in two ways:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rstriquer/adminrtr.git
cd adminrtr
npm install
```

2. **Install directly via NPM**
```bash
npm install rstriquer/adminrtr
```

## **Running the Project**
After installation, you can run the project just like any other ReactJS app:

```bash

```

The development server will start, and the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
